      Affirmation: "I care for myself."
    </p>
    <p class="text-white">
      Past (Hard): Recall a time when you prioritized self-care, even if you didn't recognize it then. "During a rough day at work, I took my lunch break to attend a yoga class."
    </p>
    <p class="text-white">
      Present (Medium): Share how you currently show self-care. "I walk instead of drive when I can to include some extra exercise."
    </p>
    <p class="text-white">
      Future (Easy): Envision scenarios where you keep caring for yourself. "I plan to cook healthy meals this week to feel good and meet my weight goals."
